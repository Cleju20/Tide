TIDE has no affiliation and/or endorsement to any of the applications/programs used within it's code, but wishes to thank the creators of these 
applications/programs for their dedication in their creations.

Further gratitude is given to all persons, forms, tutorials, QnA and the like that exist in assisting the creation of TIDE.

TIDE has little persistent features and has been written for use with Kali Linux and Xterm. If an application/program is required for use of 
some of the functions button to download that requirement is provided.

The applications/programs leveraged by TIDE each have their own Usage Warnings and/or Disclaimers. The creators of TIDE does not condone the 
usage of these applications/programs for illegal activities and/or usage without prior consent. 

TIDE was created for educational purposes and is distributed under a GNU GPLv3 or any later version, which entitles the running, studying, 
sharing, and modifying of TIDE.

Current known issues / bugs:
Issue that causes terminals to be persistent on next startup. (probably caused by Kali Linux persistence)


TIDE Detailed:

TIDE's leverage of other applications within a single program management system is deemed more necessary in Kali Linux due to the amount 
of terminals required to run a variety of programs and features.

TIDE should be considered both a functional way of operating and also act as a guide for understanding Python coding in a vanilla state. 
Many examples of code exist within and can be used to problem solve other projects one may have.

The reasons for using the code within the manner it was done is to effectively make features work and editable within a shorter amount of 
time. While some of the code can be looked at as 'dirt' or requiring clean-up, the code was written to be simpler to understand.

Due to the nature of Kali Linux requirements, many redundancies exist on different tabs, this was done so that one does not need to navigate 
to another tab to find a function they require for the operations/features that exist within the tab they are presently on. 

Basic notes and headers are included within the code which has been laid out in order of tab appearance and then subdivided further into 
operational types. While some code exists out of place, this is either for functionality, or the creators are to lazy to rectify it, who could say.

Mainly the choice to use Python vanilla was to teach some of what Python is capable of prior to adopting additional libraries. Effectively, 
Python in a vanilla state, is more often then not able to code one's requirements without the additional. 

Currently TIDE is a version one state with future expansion to be undertaken. Later, and with guidance and input from other parties, 
TIDE hopes to expand functionality for other distributions of Linux and also to Microsoft Windows while still making it better for Kali Linux.

Although it's creation has been many years in the works due to having day jobs, great enjoyment and frustration was had in it's creation. 
Remembering several sleepless nights working code in one's head and those joyous moments when it finally works the way intended. Every tab and 
character bearing the will for it's creation.
